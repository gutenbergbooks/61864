<h2><i>Drippings From the Fawcett</i></h2>

</div>

<p><i>Ye Editor is now touring these great and glorious
United States in quest of the Famed Pedigreed Bull, and
in this issue we are intending to give a wider variety as a
result of our visits to the East, South and the golden West.</i></p>

<p><i>We had the pleasure of spending an afternoon at the
New York studio as a personal guest of D. W. Griffith, in
addition to peeping behind Broadway’s scenes, and at this
writing we are “courting Satan” in the domain of Fatty
Arbuckle et al., California’s movie camps.</i></p>

<p><i>If we seem to carry too much gossip in this issue from
Hollywood and Los Angeles, please pardon us. We’ll be
leaving soon for the deer hunting grounds in Minnesota,
but in the meantime, of course, we will have to go to San
Francisco, “The City of Health, Wealth and Beauty,” for
first-hand information on Movieland’s latest and biggest
sensation!</i></p>

<p class="dropcap">Well, Kind Readers, I woke up the other
morning with a grouch and the reason
for it is just this: Gus, the hired man,
jumped his job and I had to do the morning
chores myself. At that moment I could waft
forth onto the silvery air the sweetest scent
you ever scented. To make matters all the
worse, one of the cows kicked over the milk
pail when I was half through the job. She also
added insult to injury by swishing her mucky
old tail in my face.</p>

<p>But to get back to Gus. Really, I don’t think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
he played exactly fair. After he had enjoyed
several aeroplane rides and a wonderful trip
to New York and Atlantic City, he became obsessed
with the idea that the sun rose and set in
his face—that it was his bounden duty to hang
up the moon and take down the sun each evening.
Really, Fellow Soaks, I couldn’t get him
even to feed the pet monkey which I gave him
as a present for assumed faithfulness. Previously
I had a confidential talk with him regarding
a boat which was badly in need of a
coat of white lead and tar. He became quite
haughty at the idea that I should expect him
to act as Indian guide and hired man at the
same time, so he threw his hands in the air and
yelled: “I’m through.” And I guess he is
through, for the last time I saw him that morning
he was spinning away to Minneapolis.</p>

<p>Right at this point, I must get somewhat
confidential. My opinion of Gus is that he was
lonesome for Robbinsdale—and its nearby suburb,
Minneapolis. Breezy Point at Pequot,
Minnesota, is thoroughly dry on account of its
location in the Indian territory. When Gus is
thirsty, he’s good and thirsty and it is my honest
belief that some day in the future he’ll come
back to the old homestead again.</p>

<p>Well, Gus, if you ever read these lines, Good
Luck to you and God bless you—though I do
feel like saying Gosh Darn you instead.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">Every now and then it falls my lot to
awaken with deep emotions of remorse.
When the harvest of a misspent night has
been reaped and garnered, the “morning after”
invariably finds me with a sort of null and void
feeling. Here I am in the old red barn of the
Whiz Bang farm endeavoring to gather some
fertile copy for the November issue. My poor,
fatigued brain refuses to move to action. It is
quite comparable to the brain of a univalve
mollusk. I can find but one palliative for my
purely personal woes and that is the twentieth
amendment.</p>

<p>Oh, for the days of Omar Khayyam. His
immortal Rubaiyat is a masterpiece for the
“rounder.” Had he lived in this modern
generation a different title would have graced
his writings. We would probably be reading a
booklet entitled “The Philosophy of An Old
Sport,” or probably that short and sweet title,
“Wine, Women and Song.” Whenever I feel
like a fatuous fathead, a certain degree of
relief always can be gained in perusing Omar’s
bull. And so today, while I have a look of
languor like a homesick bum, I am repeating
herewith some of his verses which may find an
appeal to “The old sport who sat in the grand
stand chair.” Here they are:</p>

<p class="dropcap">We surely are getting lots of tourists
in Minnesota this year. Just at the
close of the hunting season we saw a
pennant on the back of a Ford of the vintage
of 1904 or 1905 which read “Clymer, Pa.”</p>

<p class="dropcap">Fishing season was brought to an
eventful close at my summer resort,
Breezy Point Lodge, in the Indian
country of Northern Minnesota this month and
now all we have to do is sit around all winter
and recount experiences with the hook and line.</p>

<p>The day the season closed four of us boarded
a raft and put out into Big Pelican Lake for a
day’s angling. I had a very strong line and
towards the close of the day was rewarded with
a big bite from a Great Northern pike. The
pike nearly ran away with the line, but the
four of us held on and Mr. Fish pulled us
almost to shore. When we reached shallow
water we grabbed the line and made a half
hitch around a tree while one of the party
pumped the fish full of shotgun pellets. It was
then we discovered that the fish had swallowed
a young fawn and that the fawn, after being
swallowed, kicked its legs through the belly of
the fish, and thus the fish, when it reached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
shallow water, had been able to walk almost to
shore. What was that you said? Yes, sure,
make it Bourb’n!</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">This is a plea for fair play. Fatty
Arbuckle at this writing hasn’t been
convicted of any crime. Testimony by
one of the prosecuting witnesses is claimed by
the defense as showing Miss Rappe voluntarily
entering what later proved to be her death
chamber. We are not taking that as evidence
to remove guilt or do we claim that it excuses
Fatty for his alleged actions.</p>

<p>The “exposure” of Fatty’s past actions by
daily newspapers ought not to be news to
regular Whiz Bang readers. For more than a
year we have “kidded” Fatty, in our “movie
pages,” for his famous “pajama parties,” and
dedicated the cover of our August, 1920, issue
to Fatty’s “heart-breaking” playfulness in
Hollywood.</p>

<p>A recent report to the Whiz Bang was to
the effect that Mr. Arbuckle bought the
Randolph Miner home on West Adams Street,
Los Angeles, because it was supposed to hold a
thirty thousand dollar cellar.</p>

<p class="dropcap">We are reminded, by an enthusiastic
reader, of the old story of the man who

<p class="dropcap">Deacon Miller, my long-haired
neighbor, doesn’t approve of the aeroplane
which I purchased recently any more
than he does of my Whiz Bang. When our
hired man told the Deacon about my purchase
of the plane, old Miller grunted and snorted
and said he wouldn’t own any fool thing that
would fly and not lay any eggs.</p>

<p class="dropcap">We have it from the Seattle Post
Intelligencer that the Justamere farm
at Mount Vernon, Washington, is the
home of Colony Zarilda Cornucopia, the only
33,000-pound pedigreed bull in the state. I’d
hate to be the hired man that had to throw this
bull every day.</p>

<p class="dropcap">My, my, my, what an agitation we have
started over the definition of a
“Whiffenpoof.” A Kansas reader avers
that everybody is wrong so far; that a
“Whiffenpoof” is a bird that eats red pepper
and has to fly backwards to keep his tail from
catching on fire.</p>

<p class="dropcap">My new hired man, Pete, hangs around
the hog pen so much that he apparently
has learned most of his manners from
the animals. The other night we went to
supper at neighbor Nelson’s place and our
hired man tried to make a hit with Tillie, old
man Nelson’s daughter. A few days later I
asked Tillie how she liked Pete.</p>

<p>“Oh,” she exclaimed, “At supper he acted
like a pig and after supper he was such a bore.”</p>

as Tillie is concerned.</p>

<h3>Those Inquisitive Aussies</h3>

<p>An Australian editor tells this story—</p>

<p>An old lady, at the conclusion of the war,
was paying a visit to Madame Jarley’s Wax
Works. Carefully sizing up a group of figures
representing various ancient queens, including
Queen Elizabeth and Mary Queen of Scots, she
asked an attendant if they wore any underwear
under this gorgeous raiment. The attendant
replied:</p>

<p>“No, ma’am, they don’t wear any, but the
public of course thinks they do. The only
visitors we’ve ’ad as knows they don’t are some
Australian soldiers.”</p>

<h3>Hot Tamales</h3>

<p>Two jolly traveling men viewed with
unmingled pleasure the charms of a beautiful
maiden who sat opposite them in the palatial
Twentieth Century Limited. To their surprise
and further happiness, the fair charmer
suddenly removed her stockings, turned them
inside out and replaced them, being careful to
roll them stylishly to half-hose length. The
drummers were quite worried as to why she
went through this performance. Finally one
of them screwed up courage enough to ask her
point blank. Here’s her pert reply:</p>

<p>“Oh, my legs were hot and I just turned the
hose on them.”</p>

<h3>An Eye Opener</h3>

<p>She was sweet seventeen and just emancipated
from the thraldom of school, but already she
had her “best boy,” who on some special
occasion gave her a gold watch.</p>

<p>Some days later he inquired if she had told
her friends of his little gift.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” she said “all of them.”</p>

<p>“Did you say who gave it to you?”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” replied the artless maiden.
“We always gave one kiss for each chocolate at
school. But for a gold watch! Well, I thought
it best to say mamma gave it to me.”</p>

<h3>Heard On the Toonerville</h3>

<p>It was pitch dark along the road and had
anybody been listening in the shrubbery they
would have heard the voice of a woman
remonstrating with a man. “I won’t,” exclaimed
the woman, “I think you are a brute.”</p>

<p>“You’ll either do what I say or get out and
walk home,” roared the deep voice of the man.</p>

<p>“All right, I’ll walk,” said the woman, “but
wait till I tell my husband. I paid my fare and
you rang it up just before we left the city
limits,” and she indignantly left the street car.</p>

<p>Bright’s wife prided herself on being

while her husband talked for half an hour with
a gentleman in the parlor she turned the alarm
clock so it rang a second and then called, “John,
you are wanted on the phone.” The caller said
good-bye and John came back to his wife with
an amused smile. “Well, that’s one way to get
rid of them,” said friend wife. “What did he
want?” “Oh, nothing,” replied her husband,
“he was just a solicitor trying to get me to
have a telephone put in.”</p>

have to have “alluring” names to be successful.—<b><i>Legit.</i></b></p>

<p>Quite right, Legit. The “movies” ought to
tone down their titles so as to make them drab
and commonplace and on a par with such stage
successes, as “Mary’s Ankle,” “Up in Mabel’s
Room,” “Twin Beds,” and the recent Broadway
hit, “Getting Gertie’s Garter.” The last must

<p>Yes, indeed—here in Robbinsdale and

to agitate its tail-tip to entice grazing, curious
creatures. The white underneath part of
several varieties of deer are said to be used as
a guide for other members of the herd. The
horse uses his tail as a sun shade for the driver.
Probably there are other animals that use
their tails, but as we have never taken our
post-graduate degree in tail technology, this
meager answer will have to suffice for the
present.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">Apropos of the recent reports of a
Geraldine Farrar and Lou Tellegen
matrimonial “tangle,” Whiz Bang’s
astute investigators have heard some interesting
gossip among the imported French actors of
Hollywood’s colony.</p>

<p>They report a story, which went the rounds
in Paris just before Mr. Tellegen’s marriage to
the great prima donna, to the effect that Lou
was much infatuated at one time with an
actress of the French capital, but that this
“Love” was then on the struggling rung of the
ladder of fame and with her name yet to make.</p>

<p>Of late our Frenchie friends are saying this
actress has attained fame and fortune in Paris,
which brings up the speculation as to the
possibilities of Lou’s wayward thoughts
returning to the scene of early days. Then
again all this talk may be plain bull of the
press agent variety to advertise Tellegen’s new
play “Don Juan,” which soon will open in New
York.</p>

<p>After the failure of Lou’s play, “Blind
Youth,” on the stage to startle the public, he
announced his intentions of devoting talents to
the cinema art. Subsequently he played and
directed at the Lasky and Goldwyn lots, but
the Pickfords and Chaplins continued to hold
a monopoly on the “silent applause.” Now Lou
is returning to his former art before the footlights,
and we wish him much luck. Lou is a
good actor as everybody knows, but we can’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
all be on top, as our friend Owen Moore might
remark.</p>

<p>Everyone who has had any close association
with the premier song bird, Geraldine, loves
her. When she lived in Hollywood her sweet
strains were heard as early as five and six
o’clock in the morning. Often she was up at
daybreak to practice for a concert tour. Frequently
she arrived at the studio before eight
o’clock and played all day and in the evening
entertained friends with opera selections. In
spite of the very busy life she led, Mrs. Tellegen
(Geraldine Farrar) always was good natured
and radiant with enthusiasm, and she has been
placed among America’s most remarkable
women. Geraldine has never been known to
“high-tone” studio menials, and it is said that
Geraldine is of a forgiving nature for any
flirting by Lou when they are apart, but that
she insisted on Tellegen keeping to the home
fireside when they were lucky enough to be in
the same city. There is much speculation as
to the final outcome of the Tellegen and Farrar
ventures.</p>

<h3>Truth at Last</h3>

<p>During the week of the Fair there occurred
an incident which is worth recording. A big
six-foot bully was shooting off his mouth in the
rotunda of a hotel, evidently having had a
snifter or two, announcing that he could lick
anybody in sight. A quiet little man came
from a seat in the corner, and, walking straight
up to the giant, called him a four-flusher. The
bully thereupon handed the little man a biff on
the jaw, a smash between the eyes and lifted
him two feet off the floor with an uppercut.
The little man was carried upstairs and put to
bed.</p>

<h2>Sporty New Orleans</h2>

</div>

<p class="by">BY REV. “GOLIGHTLY” MORRILL</p>

<p class="center">Pastor of People’s Church, Minneapolis, Minn.</p>

<p class="dropcap">If you want to take a course of study in the
liberal sciences of gayety and godlessness,
go to New Orleans, the Crescent City of
climate, Creole, carnival, cotton, conventions,
cane-sugar, cafes and cemeteries. Though
there are more than thirty grave-yards, it is
not a dead town. I found week-day races and
prize fights on Sunday, as well as other religious
services. It has been called the great winter
resort of the United States, and there are
enough “resorts” by day and night for all the
good and bad who care to patronize them.</p>

<p>Pleasure is the big word in the dictionary of
New Orleans life. Her morals, as well as her
markets, are French. She is the commercial
gateway to the Panama Canal. Her citizens
have improved the city sewage and water
supply, paved the streets, erected fine hotels
and public buildings, and enlarged her port
facilities. If she mends her ways as much
morally, she will be a safe place for pious as
well as political and carnival celebrations.</p>

<p>One night after I had taken in three dozen
oysters and washed them down with French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
drip coffee, I took in a night-court where people
of black skin were sentenced for cracking and
breaking some of the laws; a gambling-hell
where money was stacked up and pulled down
on the turn of a card; a cafe and cabaret where
the colored man was outshining his white
brother elsewhere; and then strolled through a
shady district of all shades of color and
character. The denizens of the vice dens
started a street fight. They threw stones and
shoes which I dodged, and hurled hard, vile
names which deeply impressed me. Girls, not
cursed with an incorruptible chastity, in
tempting dishabille, tripped along the street
and ogled me. The doors of some of these
places of contraband amusement were wide
open to welcome the visitor, while others were
shut and bore a placard with some such
reassuring information that “MABEL IS
ENGAGED—CALL LATER.” During the war
this Broadway to Baal, Avenue to Avernus,
Hell’s Highway, and Promenade to Perdition
was temporarily closed for moral repairs and
sanitary improvements. Degradation slope was
graded, and a curb set up for evil-doers. But
far be it from me to injure the reputation of
New Orleans for wantonness and frivolity. The
fact that these places were officially closed for
a while need not deter those who journey here
today for these simple pleasures, and from
easily finding them. No war order can change
the leopard spots of the city. The Epicurean
motto, “Let us eat, drink and be merry,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
prevails according to time-honored custom. I
attended a theatre which offered a bill that
would not be tolerated in any other city of the
United States. Jokes and clothes were “pulled
off” in a way to make the blase blush.</p>

<p>The Crescent City is cosmopolitan and has
all the races, but the most flourishing is the
horse-race. Betting was the main thing. The
horses were fast, but the women at the track
were faster. A petite Parisian petticoat
invited me to take her out here every day to
bet on the races—but I thought I better not.
During the Mardi Gras Waterloo’s “revelry by
night” was outdone. Streets were a riot of
rogues and rampant ribaldry a mad pageant
of music, masks and merriment, a mob of men
and maidens. Whatever the parade seemed to
be outside, it was plain the Devil’s spirit was
inside. If one is afflicted with naughty
propensities, this is a fine place to get rid of
them. I attended a Bal Masque. The manager
lamented the passing of the good old times
when drinks were allowed to be sold and
dancers got stewed, yet said his real estate
ventures in <b><i>maisons de joie</i></b> were flourishing.
The dancers, jumping to the accompaniment of
the jazz, acted no more like dancers than the
blare, blow and crash of the jazz seemed like
music. They jerked about like automatons and
marionettes, “hesitated” like victims of
locomotor-ataxia, hopped like grasshoppers,
and moved with a stop, spring and shuffle, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
squirm, a swerve, a swirl, a slide and a slip. It
was enough to make Terpsichore sick. The
players made hard work of it and the dancers
should have received good wages for such
strenuous labor, for it was simply a dance
“haul.”</p>

<p>In New Orleans, earthly gastronomy and
not heavenly astronomy is the science most
studied in its “courses.” Many are the
toothsome taverns in this Lotus-eating town.
I remember one time-eaten cafe where there
was a di-“stink”-tive garlic atmosphere, and
where the soup was seasoned by falling plaster.
Over the tattered table-cloth, evidently changed
for every hundredth guest, French drip coffee
had dripped. Antique china and silver service
had served their day and long since should have
decorated the windows of a curio shop. It was
old with cracks, nicks and dents. What jokes
were cracked over them? What sweet stories
had the ears of the sugar-bowl listened to?
With what wide astonishment had the mouth
of the pitcher gasped at off-color stories? What
hands had caressed the neck of vinegar and oil
bottle? What cutting remarks and thrusts the
knives and forks suggested! What spooning of
callow couples the spoons had witnessed! The
table was superannuated, shaky on its pins, and
subject to ague-fits, while the chairs had felt
so many rounds of pleasure that they were
nearly all in with broken backs, twisted feet
and elliptical legs. The old lamps had looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
down on eyes of beauty whose light had been
shut out by death, and the weather-stained
walls echoed to steps that led down to the
grave.</p>

<p>Passing through the French Market, with
its dingy stalls, dogs, dirt, cobwebs, spiders and
poverty, I came to the old Absinthe House, the
refuge rendezvous of the picturesque Bordeaux
blacksmith, pirate, smuggler and slave-trader,
Jean Lafitte, the bold, bad buccaneer who loved
beauty, booze, and blood, and had barrels of
money to spend for them. Standing at the little
old marble bar, I drank a befitting toast to his
memory in absinthe. “Look not upon the
absinthe when it is green,” yet I tasted it here
and in Paris, though never sufficiently to get
the full benefit of excitation, hallucination,
terrifying dreams, delirium and idiocy. I left
these spirits to call on those of the Haunted
House nearby where of yore colored slaves
were found mutilated, held in sharp, spiked
iron bands, and chained to the wall.</p>

<p>The old time Southerners are gone. They
did not have five-reel thriller movies, horse
races, prize fights and carnivals, but they did
have some innocent pastimes with which their
simple natures were satisfied—pleasures that
beguiled the worn and weary hours. Public
executions and hangings were quite the rage
then; pirates were hung on the square for
decoration; the heads of negroes were stuck on
spikes at the city gates. At the Calabozo there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
were whipping posts and hot irons with which
the fleur de lis was burned on culprit’s
breaking some of the laws; a gambling-hell
where money was staked up and pulled down
shoulders. The only hangings I saw were of
idlers hanging around the corners. Then the
old Plaza was the center of social and
commercial life, military fete and the fate of
criminals who were shot, nailed alive in their
coffins, or slowly sawed in half. The attractions
were sometimes varied by hanging women on
the gallows and breaking men on the wheel.</p>

<p>In those days there were no Sunday jazz
bands or vaudeville circuits, but in Congo
Square in the open air there were dancing
carnivals with half-naked girls, and real
Voodoo dancers at Ponchartrain, of the old
tom-tom fiddle and gourd drum variety, who
danced themselves crazy and fell into a frothy
fit.</p>

<p>What modern social balls can compare with
the Indian balls where saffron sirens with
sweet look and voice led the dance through
love’s labyrinth of jealousy! Now there is
horse racing and private and polite gambling—then
there was wide open faro and roulette,
and later the Louisiana lottery.</p>

<p>Women did not possess the face and figure
characteristic of modern New Orleans belles,
but there society was very select, in fact, they
were “selected” from hospitals and correction
homes. Later there came a shipment of “casket<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
girls,” poor girls sent over from Paris by the
King as wives. They brought their trousseau
in a chest of clothes. This seems very primitive
to us now, yet today men pick wives no better
than these, and some they choose do not wear
clothes enough for a shroud in the coffin.</p>

<p>The city was once a sink or swamp filled
with deported galley-slaves, trappers, miners,
gold hunters and soldiers whose profession was
dice, dueling and idleness. Today it is the big,
busy, commercial city of the South. Once there
was fever, filth and filibusters, but these things
are no longer in fashion. New Orleans now
buys white rice, cotton and sugar—in early
days she bought black slaves from San
Domingo and Guinea.</p>

<p>Charles Lamb liked old things—he would
have enjoyed the old part of town with its
bizarre balconies, mountain-peaked roofs, hill-shaped
sheds, begrimed, battered stairways,
open flowery courts, shady portieres, quaint
doorways, and ramshackle, rickety rows of
houses marshalled on both sides of the streets
like awkward squads of soldiers. In the quiet
streets one looks in doorways where the
inhabitants, listless lazy lovers of pleasure, are
dozing away Life’s afternoon. Here you find
the beautiful and bewitching Creoles, coquettish
damsels whose baby years were cuddled and
cradled in sentimental songs such as “I love
you as a little pig loves the mud.”</p>

<p>The pleasure-seeker is “stuck” on New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Orleans with its lasses, molasses, lassitude and
laissez-faire morals.</p>

<p class="by">“<i>The Bull is Mightier Than the Bullet.</i>”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Tiajuana is a small town in Mexico just
across the border from San Diego. It is
the Havana of the west coast. The other
day a theatre had just opened up to show the
films of the Carpentier-Dempsey fight when
the building caught fire and burned film and
all. It was a tough day for the movies also in
San Diego, for the “cops” at a nearby beach
resort chose the day for raiding a playhouse
that was screening a South American film
called “Adam and Eve.”</p>

<p>According to the police there was an undue
exposure of the feminine anatomy in the case
of Eve. Mebbe so! We have not had the
pleasure of seeing this tid-bit. But, it must
have been some exposure if it had anything on
the Aphrodite of the galleries and the halls of
sculpture that are accepted as the product of
“Art” and held immune from the incongruous
draperies of Gothic prudery.</p>

<p>On our bathing beaches, too, everything goes
on and off, and more than mere legs is visible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
to the naked eye unashamed. Why then, is the
feminine form divine the most indecent product
of the Creator’s handiwork? We have asked
Gus and he says that all the girls of his
acquaintance are bow-legged. That lets Gus
out of the symposium. Perhaps some of the
prude morality mongers can enlighten a poor,
hard-working farmer from Robbinsdale.</p>

<p>Feminine modesty may be only shoe-high
and roll-top stockings an incitement to
masculine pruriency—but, thank heaven, most
of us are not fashioned that way. The censorial
Puritan may blush like an over-ripe tomato at
the complete revelation of the feminine knee-joint.</p>

<p>However, no masculine connoisseur is
going to do an emotional handspring over
such a trivial, especially when it is common
observation that three-quarters of the lower
quarters, and other quarters that one sees
parading down Main street nowadays, are too
fat or too skinny or too gnarled to raise much
of a ripple on a regular guy’s masculinity.</p>

<p>Immodesty is a relative term and a silk
stocking, properly stocked, is not our idea of
indecency. Therefore, we don’t incline to the
grannies’ view that the bare leg on stage or
screen is immodest for the very reason that the
fat leg and the skinny leg and the bow-legged
leg don’t get there. Or, at least, they don’t stay
there long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">Why does a man, having spent his years
from the time of puberty to young
manhood in an orgy of flagrant living
and self-indulgence, demand of the honored girl
whom he makes his wife that she be of virginal
purity? And why in the name of all that is
civilized should he adhere to the idea that no
matter how degenerate he becomes, his wife
should bring to him an unimpeachable chastity?</p>

<p>Our average young wife seeker, following
the action of Diogenes, conducts a vigilant
search and after a time he finds the girl who
is his conception of the perfect feminine and
marries this most fortunate young lady. Then
in the course of events he discovers or thinks
he discovers a shadow in his wife’s early career,
a shadow occurring before he illuminated with
his presence the horizon of her life.</p>

<p>In a great display of righteous indignation
he rises upon his hind legs, lays back his ears
and in a loud voice fairly quivering with holy
wrath and outraged decency, he verbally and
sometimes physically flays his wife.</p>

<p>And then to secure balm for his wounded
spirit he hies himself with all possible haste to
the divorce courts, where he assures the world
that he is a worthy young man of impeccable
character; that he, a paragon of virtue, has
been tricked into a marriage with a creature of
the streets and that he is ineradicably
besmirched. Is he not a member in high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
standing of the Y.M.C.A. and the B.Y.P.U.
and therefore blameless?</p>

<p>After he has succeeded in establishing his
claim to godliness through the process of
dragging his wife’s name through the mire of
the courts he feels the need of consolation; so
cranking his trusty automobile, he flivvers
down some shady avenue, inviting passing
flappers to share the honor of his society and
the pleasure of his car.</p>

<p>Puritanically speaking, such a standard of
morality was considered quite the proper
thing but Puritanism flourished during the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, which time
incidentally, is far removed from the present.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">Far be it from us to harp too much on
styles. We believe if a girl has shapely
limbs and a sparkling pair of eyes she
has as much right to show one as the other and
as an anonymous writer in a Minneapolis
newspaper says, “There is no such thing as
immodest dress—it is all in the mind.”</p>

<p>Samuel Butler says: “Even Euclid had to
assume something before he could prove
anything. Truly we live by faith.” Thus it
can be said that it is all in the mind. But I
do submit that what a thing is to anyone, lies
in his reaction or response to it not in the thing
itself. If in a painting, a statue or a shapely
pair of legs beneath a short skirt, one person
sees only the beauty, an esthetic reaction to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
grace, perfect proportion or symmetry, while
another “sees red.” Where lies the cause? The
object viewed is the same. Therefore, as
someone so aptly put it, “it is all in the eyes
of the beholder.”</p>

<p>If short skirts and low necks arouse sex
instincts, why howl about it? Rather be happy
in the knowledge that one is normal, for the
sex instinct is a natural one. When sex desire
stops, the physical manifestations of life will
cease. Those thoughts may require self-control,
but since that element is a necessary
concomitant to civilized society, the exercise
of it will be beneficial. The trend of human
progress, while almost imperceptible, appears
to be toward the ideal in human relations and
away from the cocoanut throwing hit-her-on-the-head-with-a-club
status, and if some men
can’t withstand the sight of bare knees they
are insufficiently advanced in the scale of
civilization.</p>

<p>Which brings us to a quotation by
Stevenson, that all reformers and custodians of
the neighbors’ morals would do well to heed.
It is: “There is an idea abroad among moral
people that they should make their neighbors
good. One person I have to make good—myself.
But my duty to my neighbor is much
more nearly expressed by saying that I have
to make him happy if I may.” Live and let
live.</p>

<h3>Your Letter, Lady, Came Too Late</h3>

<p><i>The following beautiful and touching lines were written
during the Civil War by an officer of the Confederate army,
at the time a prisoner on Johnson Island. A young Georgian,
when the war broke out, was engaged to be married to the
most beautiful and brilliant belle of Savannah, but died in
captivity. While he lay dead, a letter came from this young
lady to her late lover. It was a cruel, cold, heartless letter,
altogether different in tone and in manner from any she ever
had written to him. She spoke of brilliant balls she had
lately dealt with, unconcealed rapture upon the innumerable
perfections of a certain colonel of General Wheeler’s staff—of
his manly form, his exquisite dancing, his marvelous conversational
powers—closing with these chilling words:
“Respectfully, Virginia.” Hitherto she had ended her letters
with: “Your own devoted and faithful Virginia.” This letter
was received at the prison a few hours after the death of him
to whom it was addressed, and replied to by his comrade as
follows:</i></p>

<h2>Naughty New York</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Doug and Mary and Charley almost made
Broadway forget to curse the landlords.</p>

<p>The wildest crowd I have seen in New
York since Armistice Day was the gang that
jammed into Forty-second Street the day that
Fairbanks’ movie, “The Musketeers,” opened.
Taxi cabs had to stop a block away and let the
passengers fight their way into the theatre if
they could.</p>

<p>I saw two girls shove Jack Dempsey out of
the way to get a look at Doug and his wife.
They just dug their little elbows into the
illustrious ribs of the Champ, and rough housed
him to one side out of their line of vision. I
guess the Fairbanks family can consider this
to be about the summit of human fame. I once
saw a big crowd run away from a reception to
the President of the United States, leaving that
august personage talking to the empty air in
order to see a heavy weight champion; but I
never imagined that anything could take a
crowd away from a champ. Compared to
Doug and Mary as rival attractions, Dempsey
was nothing but a broad back that was difficult
to see around.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>I’m telling you the truth, children. The
day that Doug and Mary went to Boston, the
crowds lined the railroad track at every station
as though it were the Royal Mogul passing by.</p>

<p>Charley Chaplin didn’t register very heavily—except
in the newspapers. The truth is
painful, but must be told. Charles was lost in
the shuffle. It wasn’t “his stuff” as the
newspaper men say.</p>

<p>The night the show opened, Douglas, finding
it hard to make a way through the crowd,
picked Mary Pickford up on his shoulder and
bucked his way through like a football half
back. Charley couldn’t very well pick up Jack
Dempsey on his shoulder so he played second
fiddle.</p>

<p>I don’t know what’s the matter with Charley.
His divorce suit must have been a shattering
experience. His hair is growing gray around
the edges, and his nerves seem on the raw edge.
One day he was being interviewed by a gang of
reporters in his suite at his New York hotel,
and nearly chewed off the head of one of the
newspaper men who asked him with what
American he compared Lenin, the Bolshevist.</p>

<p>Without warning, Charles tore into the
reporter and handed him a cutting rebuke for
his stupidity. He talked scornfully about “you
Americans”—which is poor stuff for Charley.</p>

<p>To tell the truth, I thought he was going
to cry. And I guess he wasn’t far from it.
Charley told me afterward that his nerves are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
in such a condition that he weeps at the
slightest excuse.</p>

<p>He should have taken a lesson from his
former bride, Mildred Harris.</p>

<p>One of the actors told me about the weeps
of the former Mrs. Chaplin. Not long ago she
was working in a picture under one of the De
Milles. Finding her exasperating, the director
lost his temper and fairly lashed her with his
tongue. Through the tirade, Miss Harris calmly
kept on “making up.” While he was generally
going over her sins of omission and commission,
she was carefully penciling her eyebrows,
looking sidewise into the mirror, the way they
do. When he got down to purple-faced bellows
of rage, she was going over her lips with the
lip stick. When he was generally giving an
explosive review of the ground he had already
covered, the lady was giving a final dab just
over her eye lids. Having given herself a final
and critical survey in her pocket mirror and
finding the job was worthy of her O.K., she
proceeded softly to cry at the director’s
remarks. She believes in taking up things in
their systematic and proper rotation.</p>

<p>Chaplin speaks bitterly of his married life
and at the same time glares with melancholy
rage and dismay at his first gray hairs. The
first time the newspaper photographers took
his picture on his arrival in New York, he
asked them with alarmed solicitude to retouch
the plates so his gray hairs would not show.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>The movie people in New York feel
somewhat dismayed because of Charley’s
interview with a British newspaper man
regarding Fatty Arbuckle and the killing of
Virginia Rappe in San Francisco.</p>

<p>The disposition of the movie actors on
Broadway is to pile the guilt of every movie
scandal that has occurred since the beginning
of time upon Fatty’s robust shoulders and let
him sink.</p>

<p>I was amused, however, when “Pathe”
Lehrmann rushed into the New York papers
after the killing and raved for a couple of
columns upon the deplorable condition of
Fatty’s morals in relation to women. It seems
that “Pathe” was engaged to the deceased
young lady. He is now Owen Moore’s director
at a studio in this city.</p>

<p>Among the several things, that “Pathe” says
about Fatty Arbuckle is that Fatty used to
clean spittoons in Arizona. “This,” remarks
“Pathe” witheringly, “Is what happens when
we take people out of the gutter and make them
millionaires.”</p>

<p>Well, maybe so; maybe so. But I have a
distinct recollection of “Pathe” Lehrmann
before he got into the Rolls-Royce class.</p>

<p>In an east side lodging house, Lehrmann is
not so very convincing as the one to stare
coldly at Fatty across the cold chasm of class
inferiority.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>As far as Fatty Arbuckle goes—Alas, poor
Yorick, I knew him well! He is neither the
frightful monster painted by the agitated Herr
Lehrmann, nor yet the “clear white inside”
person described by the emotional ex-husband
of Miss Harris.</p>

<p>Fatty is an ignorant fat boy with a natural
impulse to be funny. As a clown, he is there a
million. As a millionaire, he is about as
convincing as a louse on the shoulders of a
decollette heiress. He just doesn’t belong there.</p>

<p>As to the spittoons of the Arizona saloon,
well, somebody had to clean ’em. I hope he
cleaned them well.</p>

<p>It was Fatty’s misfortune that he was not
able to hush up his scandal as the scandal of
Zelda Crosby was hushed up recently in New
York.</p>

<p>Zelda Crosby was a young scenario writer.
When she was about fifteen years old she
happened to be invited to a jazz party given by
a well known movie star in New York. One
of the guests at the party was a “fillum”
magnate known over the world for his
campaign for purity, etc., in the films.</p>

<p>He took the little girl under the protection
of his influence. She developed a flare for
writing and he gave her an important job as a
scenario writer.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p>This row of stars means the usual thing
that they mean in romances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, after a while, the girl, who was now in
her twenties, realized that he was slipping
away from her. She accused him of having
met another girl for whom he cared more than
for her. Incidentally, he was a married man,
but that didn’t count.</p>

<p>The film magnate renewed his protestations
to her; but began to find fault with the quality
of her scenario work. Then one day the little
girl went into the bath room and tipped up a
bottle of poison and that was the end.</p>

<p>Well, not quite the end. A girl friend of
hers began to talk at a party. She began to
tell some very dangerous things she knew of.
It happened that this girl’s name is the same
as that of a great screen star.</p>

<p>In a panic the film magnate heard what was
said at the party. He hurried off to the
astonished star a telegram threatening openly
to ruin her entire screen career if she ever
opened her mouth again about this scandal.
Her indignant reply disclosed to the magnate
that he had sent a telegram to the wrong girl
by mistake.</p>

<p>Then, brethren, there was truly a fine
howdydo, and it all came out in the papers—at
least some of it did.</p>

<p>One young man—a journalist hanging on
the ragged edge of decency, stated that he had
some inside facts and intended to bring the
whole thing out in a grand jury investigation.
But he never got to the grand jury and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
whole thing was suddenly hushed up. I leave it
to you to imagine what happened.</p>

<p>It looks like a rotten year for the theatre
business—and perhaps for other business.</p>

<p>At this writing there is not one legitimate
show in New York doing any business. “Six
Cylinder Love,” a comedy about a family which
buys an automobile before they can really
afford to do so, is supposed to be the one big hit
of New York and it has already been forced to
take blocks of its tickets over to the reduced
rate ticket office to be sold at a discount.</p>

<p>Already, with the season hardly started, the
beach is strewn with wrecks. One month, after
the opening of the season, some nineteen shows
had gone broke and had been taken off.</p>

<p>To be honest about it, I think most of
the nineteen richly deserved it. For some
unaccountable reason, nearly all the shows are
infernally talky this year. The curtain goes
up on a pair of people who gabble at you over
the footlights until you have the blind staggers.
When they—and you—are groggy, another pair
take up the talk fest. Nothing ever happens
but chatter. This is supposed to be the new
“literal” and “realistic” school.</p>

<p>The high brow authors contend that their
characters gabble over nothing for hours in
real life; therefore, they should gabble by the
hour about nothing in mimic life. By the same
token I dare say they will show them putting
hair lotion on their bald spots and trimming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
their corns and performing the other manifest,
but not thrilling or interesting, duties of life.</p>

<p>If we are going to be realistic, b’gosh let’s
be really so.</p>

<p>One of the few real successes of the theatre
season is a coy and refined young comedy for
the pure and young; it is called “Finding
Gertie’s Garter.”</p>

<p>Al Woods, the promoter thereof, cheerfully
admits all the rough things the papers and the
preachers say about it. Al says that last year
he listened to the critics who spurred him on
to do his duty toward art and refinement.
Result, he lost $75,000 on two high-brow plays.
Hereafter, he is for bedroom farces “first, last
and alla time” as politicians say.</p>

<p>Which brings us to Irving Berlin, the song
writer who is just about to blossom out as a
producer with a beautiful theatre of his own.</p>

<p>Irving began where Fatty Arbuckle did—or
nearly there. He was a waiter and song
shouter in a tough cafe on the East Side.</p>

<p>In Berlin’s case, however, he went steadfastly
to work and began writing songs. At
first he sang his own songs in the cafe; then
he got them published. Now he is a millionaire
and has the additional distinction of being one
of the men who were engaged to Constance
Talmadge before she was carried off by a
fascinating Greek millionaire.</p>

<p>In fact, Irving was the last of the jilted
ones. He got his dismissal from Connie down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
in Florida. When he came back nursing
bruised and broken love hopes some one asked
him about the climate in Florida.</p>

<p>“Fine air I hear, Irving?” said the friend.</p>

<p>“Yes” said Irving, “And I got the air.”</p>

<h3>Embolusing the Thrombosis</h3>

<p>Question (to doctor on witness stand in
murder case)—“Just tell the jury what, in your
opinion, caused the death of the late Mr.
Scrapple.”</p>

<p>Answer—“Well, when deceased laid down his
full house with buoyancy of spirit and was
about to reach for the pot, the accused, Mr.
Jopkins, cried out, ‘Hold on! What’s the matter
with them four treys?’ This sudden cessation
of undue elation on the part of the late Mr.
Scrapple created an anti-climax and caused the
blood of the myocardium to go galloping round
and round the heart, thus supercharging the
pulmonary arteries until the renal, splenic and
cerebral vessels went to pieces and left the
embolus lodging crosswise against the primary
thrombosis. Thus it is self-evident that the
booze he had obviously been imbibing became
partially coagulated, forming an aneurism
which brought about a spiflication of the sine
quo non. This would, I think, be sufficient to
cause death.”</p>

<h3>How’re Everythings?</h3>

<p>A Boston youth is the hero of this account
in the “Globe”:</p>

<p>His parents were what is known as
“high-brow,” but they also were good sports.
So, when he suggested taking them to a
restaurant in the market district of Boston,
they agreed.</p>

<p>The mother’s exquisite clothes stamped her
as a society woman, but democracy reigns
supreme at the market restaurant.</p>

<p>They sat down at the table. The waiter
handed the mother a menu and then leaned
confidentially forward over the back of the
chair and said:</p>

<p>“Well, sister, what’s the good news?”</p>

<h3>Philosophy of the Modern Flapper</h3>

<p class="center sans">By Jane Gaites.</p>

<p>Tonight when you shall gather me in your
strong loving arms and marvel at the radiance
of my eyes, the golden glamour of my hair, the
velvety softness of my pink cheeks, while you
tell me you love me, I shall smile.</p>

<p>And you will be content thinking that I
smile because of love for you. You will wonder
at my naivete, at my simplicity, and innocence.
You do not know of my rows and rows of
expensive jars that make me beautiful. You
do not guess that untold experience has made
me “simple.”</p>

<p>And when you draw me even closer to you
and kiss me again, more passionately, while
you smile at my sweet demureness and
simplicity, I too will smile, because with all
your vast knowledge of women—dear boy, you
are so simple!</p>
